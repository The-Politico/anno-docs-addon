What is this?
-------------

Google Apps Script Addon to add annotation with frontmatter

Assumptions
-----------

The following things are assumed to be true in this documentation.

* You are running OSX.
* You are using Python 2.7. (Probably the version that came OSX.)
* You have [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) installed and working.
* You have NPR's AWS credentials stored as environment variables locally.

For more details on the technology stack used with the app-template, see our [development environment blog post](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2013/06/06/how-to-setup-a-developers-environment.html).

What's in here?
---------------

The project contains the following folders and important files:

* ``annotate`` -- Google Apps Script Add-On source files
* ``fabfile`` -- [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/) commands for automating setup, deployment, data processing, etc.
* ``templates`` -- HTML ([Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/)) templates, to be compiled locally.
* ``app.py`` -- A [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app for rendering the project locally.
* ``app_config.py`` -- Global project configuration for scripts, deployment, etc.
* ``render_utils.py`` -- Code supporting template rendering.
* ``requirements.txt`` -- Python requirements.

Bootstrap the project
---------------------

```
cd annotationAddon
mkvirtualenv annotationAddon
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problems installing requirements?** You may need to run the pip command as ``ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future pip install -r requirements.txt`` to work around an issue with OSX.

Hide project secrets
--------------------

Project secrets should **never** be stored in ``app_config.py`` or anywhere else in the repository. They will be leaked to the client if you do. Instead, always store passwords, keys, etc. in environment variables and document that they are needed here in the README.

Any environment variable that starts with ``$PROJECT_SLUG_`` will be automatically loaded when ``app_config.get_secrets()`` is called.

Run the project
---------------

A flask app is used to run the project locally. It will automatically recompile templates and assets on demand.

```
workon annotationAddon
fab app
```

Visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

Google Apps Scripts Development
-------------------------------

We use our codebase stored on github as the master for the Google Apps Scripts code. We have created a series of Fabric commands to ease the workflow of updating the actual code run inside google drive.

## List projects

```
fab gs.list_projects
```

It will return a complete list of Google Apps Script projects. It accepts and optional owner parameter to filter out the results to a given owner. for example the following command will return only the projects that you have created:

```
fab gs.list_projects:me
```

##Â Upsert project

If you want to update local changes to a Google Apps Script Project you can run:

```
fab [ENVIRONMENT] gs.upsert
```

Where `ENVIRONMENT` can be: `development`, `staging` or `production`. Depending on the environment passed the command will update the appropriate Google App Script Project using `app_config` properties. For development it would be:

```
fab development gs.upsert
```

Google Document Permissions
---------------------------

We are accessing the Live Fact Check document from the server to pull out its content using credentials associated with `nprappstumblr@gmail.com` we need to make sure that `nprappstumblr@gmail.com` has at least read access to the document in order to avoid a `403` response to the server.
